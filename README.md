Agamas are texts of Jainism based on the discourses (deshna) of the Tirthankara delivered in a samavasarana (divine preaching hall).
The agamic literature and the Purvas were passed from one head of the order to his disciples for around 980 years after the nirvana of Tirthankara Mahavira. 
It became difficult with time to keep the entire Jain literature committed to memory and written documentation started in the 5th century (~1000 years after Tirthankara Mahavira nirvana).
Jain Fundamental Beliefs:
Universe has no beginning and no end. It is everlasting, eternal and has both finite and infinite component.
The universe constitutes of six fundamental substances or entities known as Shad Dravya (Dravastikaya) and they are 
Soul (Jiva)
Matter (Pudgal)
Principle of Motion (Dhamastikaya)
Principle of Rest (Adharmastikaya)
Space (Äkäsha)
Time (Käl)
All six substances are eternal. Although, they undergo countless and continuous changes, they do not transform from one substance to another and retain their inherent qualities.
Soul (Jiva) is the only living substance, which has consciousness. Every living being is a soul. An infinite number of souls exist in the universe and they are all unique. The remaining 5 substances are non-living beings (Ajiva).
Souls are classified into two major categories: Liberated Souls and Non-Liberated souls. Liberated souls known as Siddhas have ended their cycle of birth and death and they don’t have physical bodies. There are infinite number of non-liberated souls and they all have the possibility of achieving liberation. 
Karma is one of the categories of matter (Pudgal), hence it exists since eternity.
Soul is in Mithyätva (Delusion or ignorance and wrong belief) from Eternity.
Karma is attached to the Soul from eternity. Our Mithyätva (Delusion or Illusion), Kashäya (vices) and the intention behind our actions of body, mind, and speech continue to bind us with new Karma.
Principle governing the successions of life cycles (Birth, Life, and Death) is Karma.
Aim of Jainism:
Enhance spiritual life, find happiness within and reduce kashays (greed, anger, lust, ego etc.) within.
To realize the original attributes of a Soul by removing Mithyätva and Kashäya and thereby freeing the soul from its bondage to Karma.
External renunciation is meaningless if the Soul remains fettered by internal shackles (Kashaya or vices) - Bhava-Puhad (13).
The True Nature of a substance is the Religion of a substance - - any activity of Body, Mind and Speech which reduces/removes Mithyätva and  Kashäya (Anger, Ego, Deceit, and Greed) is known as Religion.
Our conduct must be accompanied by compassion, friendship, love, sympathy, equanimity etc. otherwise it is merely mechanical action.
Mithyätva or Delusion means:
False knowledge about the attributes of our soul and worldly realities.
One does not know the Truth but one firmly believes the Untruth is Truth.
Belief is held with absolute conviction and belief is not changeable even by compelling counter argument or proof to the contrary.
Mithyätva (not Karma) is the root cause of all Sufferings.
Kashäya means Anger, Ego, Deceit, Greed, Attachment, Aversion and other vices.
